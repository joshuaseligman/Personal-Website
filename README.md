This project is my website to showcase my academic, professional, and personal life.

Prior to working on this project, I had minimal knowledge of JavaScript and some basic HTML and CSS knowledge. Instead of building a plain website with just HTML and CSS, I wanted to create a website that would easily be able to be modified and expand in size as I progress through my academic and professional journey.

This flexibility requirement leads me to the React.js web framework to build my website. I was initially impressed with React.js because it features capabilities to make general templates, or components, that define smaller parts of the website. Using basic control structures, these components can be combined in scale without having to duplicate HTML and CSS code, which was very appealing to me and my objectives.

Learning the important JavaScript and React.js concepts was as simple as watching some Youtube video tutorials, but applying these skills in practice was much more difficult. Experimenting with my website as I built it and comparing the output based on a difference in a line of code was very valuable to me as I continued to gain a deeper understanding of React.js and how each component of my website was interacting with each other in the code.

Similar techniques were used during development concerning the CSS and styling of the website. I had taken a basic HTML/CSS class in middle school and have more recently taught web design and, therefore, knew the basic tags and styling properties. However, since I needed the website to be able to expand over time, I needed to approach the design of the website from a more long-term perspective. This is where CSS flexbox came into the picture. Through reading online articles, Stack Overflow, and just experimenting with my website, I realized how powerful the flexbox layout is as it helped me to easily design my website with the ability to upscale because every child element is treated in relation to the other children. In other words, as I add more projects to the website, for instance, CSS will automatically handle the layout without me needing to write any additional code to support the new projects.

Overall, building my website was a major learning experience for me as I developed and improved upon countless software development and web design skills. However, the most important thing to note is how much fun I had working on the project. This enjoyment of working on a project while also learning is extremely motivational for me, and I look forward to continuing to build more amazing projects and expanding my skills.
